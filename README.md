# Time Series Data Analytics | Streamlit and Docker

## Introduction

Data Analytics on Ethiopia's rain and temperature data collected from the [SWAT](https://swat.tamu.edu/data/) database using various tools and technologies, including Streamlit, python3, Docker, and plotly.js

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: 
    1. python3

Tools and Data Visualization:
    1. Docker <br>
    2. Streamlit <br>
    3. Folium
    4. plotly.js



#### Created a dashboard using Streamlit and Python to monitor 67 million Ethiopia's rain and temperature time series data collected from the SWAT database. 
#### Cleaned the data using geoPy module to filter the Ethiopia's data and implemented parallel processing using Swifter and Pandarallel to manipulate data. 
#### Added functionalities to display daily average temperature, monthly mean temperature, Annual Max, Min and Avg temperature, Daily precipitation, min,max and avg precipitation, Cumulative and monthly avg precipitation. 
#### Created ethiopia's map and implemented a bi-directional communication using haversine distance to fetch the nearest location and display the fetched locations data using streamlit-folium, branca, and Numpy.
#### implemented caching technique to speed up the application loading process. 
#### Containerized the application using Docker. 
#### Deployed it on HuggingFace. (https://huggingface.co/spaces/poooja2012/ethio_hydro)
